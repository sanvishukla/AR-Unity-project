# AR-Unity-project
The "Mechanism Kit Assembly and Disassembly" project is an interactive application developed using Unity, aimed at providing an immersive experience in learning about mechanical systems. Utilizing CAD files, this project offers users the opportunity to explore, assemble, and disassemble intricate mechanisms with ease.
Key Features:

Main Menu: Upon launching the application, users are greeted with a user-friendly main menu interface. Here, they are presented with three primary options: Introduction to the Mechanism Kit, Assembly Process, and Disassembly Process.

Introduction Section: Choosing the Introduction option provides users with an overview of the mechanism kit, including its components, functionalities, and potential applications. This section serves as a foundational guide for users before diving into the assembly and disassembly processes.

Assembly Process: In this section, users engage in the step-by-step assembly of the mechanism kit. Through intuitive controls and interactive animations, users navigate through each stage of the assembly process, learning about the interplay between different components and how they come together to form a functional mechanism.

Disassembly Process: Conversely, the Disassembly Process section allows users to deconstruct the assembled mechanism step by step. Through reverse animations and guided instructions, users gain insight into the inner workings of the mechanism, understanding how each component contributes to its overall functionality.

Navigation Options: At any point during the assembly or disassembly processes, users have the option to navigate back to the main menu for easy access to other sections. This feature enhances user experience by allowing flexibility in exploration and learning.

Mobile Compatibility: The project is optimized for mobile devices, making it accessible to users on the go. By building the application for Android devices, users can conveniently access the interactive learning experience anytime, anywhere.
